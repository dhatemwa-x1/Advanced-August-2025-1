You will then sort these words into categories with your group.", grammar: "Today's focus is on lexis (vocabulary). You gain this vocabulary not just by seeing it, but by actively using it in discussion and then organizing it. This task builds your mental 'toolbox' of words related to perception, which you will need to build your story later in the week." },

In pairs, you'll analyze the specific phrases your teacher used. You will also get the instructions for your main group task.", grammar: "Today you learn this week's key grammar: Modal Verbs of Deduction (e.g., might be, must have been) and Speculative Phrases (e.g., It looks as if..., I'd hazard a guess that...). You gain this skill by seeing the language used in a perfect context and then immediately deconstructing it." },

In your group, you'll discuss your assigned photo, agree on a story, and write a single, cohesive narrative about the characters, setting, and events.", grammar: "The task of creating a story from a single image forces you to use the speculative language from Day 2. To explore different ideas, you must use phrases like, 'She could be running away from someone,' or 'He must have just received some important news.' You gain mastery through this practical, creative application." },

Then, each group will present their story to the class and answer clarifying questions.", grammar: "This task tests your ability to use speculative language for an audience. To make your story engaging, you must use the language effectively to build mystery and interest. You gain confidence by moving from the written task of Day 3 to the oral performance of today." },

You'll then summarize your article's arguments and key vocabulary in a new group with students who read the other text.", grammar: "The focus is on building topic-specific vocabulary and the skill of summarizing arguments. You gain this skill by reading a complex text and then being immediately required to explain it to someone else. This is the foundation of information gathering you'll need for the debate." },

Your teacher will help you notice specific techniques, and you will work in groups to categorize phrases from the video based on their function.", grammar: "Today you learn the key tools for debate: Hedging Language (It seems that...) and Functional Phrases for agreeing and disagreeing. You gain this skill not by just hearing the phrases, but by actively identifying and sorting them. This process turns the language from something you just hear into a toolkit you can consciously use." },
                    { day: 3, title: "Preparing for Battle", focus: "To work with your team to build your arguments and plan your debate strategy.", action: "You'll be assigned to a team and will have the entire lesson to prepare. You must brainstorm arguments, prepare counter-arguments (rebuttals), and assign speaking roles to each team member.", grammar: "The task of planning rebuttals directly forces you to think about how you will phrase your disagreements. You gain skill by strategically planning where and when to use the hedging and functional language you learned on Day 2 to make your arguments sound both strong and reasonable." },

Your team will present its arguments according to a formal structure of opening statements, rebuttals, and closing statements, all under strict time limits.", grammar: "This is where you practice using your argumentative language spontaneously. You gain true mastery not just from planning, but from performing under pressure. Responding to the other team's points in real-time is the ultimate test of how well you have absorbed the language from Day 2." },

The main focus will be on pronunciation, where you'll practice how sentence stress and intonation can make your speech more powerful and convincing.", grammar: "Today you learn that pronunciation is a grammatical tool for conveying meaning. You gain this advanced skill by drilling specific examples and hearing how emphasizing one word (e.g., 'The real issue...') can completely change the force of an argument." }

Then, after brainstorming linking words, you'll analyze a C1-level text to find all the cohesive devices the author used.", grammar: "Today's skill is identifying Discourse Markers (linking words) and their functions. You gain this skill by acting as a detective in a professional text. By actively highlighting words like however, consequently, and moreover and discussing their purpose, you begin to build a conscious awareness of how authors create logical connections." },

With a partner, you will start rebuilding the first paragraph, discussing your choices.", grammar: "You immediately apply your knowledge of discourse markers to a practical problem. The task also introduces the week's second key skill: creating complex sentences. You gain this by physically combining short sentences and choosing the right conjunctions to show the relationship between ideas." },

The task requires constant negotiation ('Should we use 'nonetheless' here? Why is it better than 'however'?'). This process of justifying your grammatical choices to your partner is what solidifies your learning." },

Afterwards, the teacher will reveal the original text, and you will analyze the author's professional choices as a class.", grammar: "You gain skill in two ways today. First, by articulating why you made certain grammatical choices, you reinforce your own knowledge. Second, by analyzing the authentic text, you are exposed to a C1-level model of how to effectively use cohesive devices and sentence structures." },

You'll also analyze the function of different types of subordinate clauses. Then you'll complete targeted practice exercises.", grammar: "Today you organize your knowledge into a mental 'map.' By systematically categorizing the discourse markers and analyzing complex sentence structures, you understand the fine differences between them.

You'll finish by reading a short article and defining these key terms based on their context.", grammar: "Today's focus is on lexis (vocabulary). You gain this skill not by memorizing a list, but by actively using the words in discussion and then cementing your understanding by defining them from a real-world text. This vocabulary is the foundation you need to perform the critical analysis required for the rest of the week." },

The first time is for the main ideas. The second time, you will use a template to take detailed notes on the core argument, evidence, and clues about the speaker's tone or bias.", grammar: "Your focus here is on identifying linguistic cues for attitude and bias. You'll gain this skill by actively listening for how the speaker uses intonation (the melody of their voice), sentence stress on certain words, and loaded or emotional vocabulary. Taking detailed notes on these specific features is how you train your ear to hear the subtle messages behind the words." },

Then, you'll work together to craft a concise summary and write two or three critical questions to challenge the speaker's ideas.", grammar: "The key skill today is paraphrasing. To create a good summary, you can't just copy the speaker's sentences; you must restate complex ideas accurately in your own words. This task forces you to find new vocabulary and sentence structures to express the same meaning. This is a core C1 skill gained through the process of collaborative writing and editing." },

You'll stand before the class, deliver your summary, and present your critical questions, leading to a wider class discussion.", grammar: "Today you practice the language of formal reporting and academic inquiry. You gain this by moving from written preparation to live speaking. You must structure your sentences clearly so the audience can understand the complex argument. Articulating your critical questions out loud is direct practice in using formal, precise language to challenge an idea respectfully." },

You will also listen to short clips from the talk again to pinpoint how the speaker's tone reveals their bias. Finally, you'll complete a worksheet where you paraphrase key sentences from the talk using the new verbs.", grammar: "This lesson gives you the exact grammatical tools to upgrade your analysis. Instead of just saying 'the speaker said,' you'll learn to use more precise and analytical verbs like, 'The speaker contended that...' or 'She implicitly suggested that...'.

Your teacher will lead a discussion on the features of professional writing, such as avoiding contractions and using sophisticated vocabulary. You will then receive the scenario for your group's proposal task.", grammar: "The key concept is register. You gain an understanding of formal register by directly comparing sentences and analyzing the model proposal's language. This is crucial because using the wrong register can cause your proposal to fail. Understanding your audience today helps you choose the right grammatical and lexical tools tomorrow." },

You gain this skill today by learning what makes a thesis debatable and clear. The task of writing and submitting one for feedback is the first and most critical step, as this single sentence will control the structure of your entire essay." },

As you create your outline, you are planning the logical flow of your argument.

The task of co-writing forces you to actively use and discuss language.

The peer feedback is crucial for catching errors. The final revision task is your last chance to check your application of all grammar points from the course—is your thesis clear? Is your cohesion logical? Is your register consistent?" },

You will actively use: Presentation Language, Argumentation and Debate Language, and Q&A Management Phrases to handle questions professionally. You gain confidence and mastery by successfully deploying this full range of C1-level linguistic skills in a challenging, live, academic situation." }
